Set up a Zap using [Zapier](https://zapier.com/sign-up) that **automatically creates a customer in Zenskar** when a new customer is created in Stripe (you can create a [free stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)) and share the following:

- A short Loom video (1-2 mins) showing the Zap setup and how it works.
- A brief note (in <200 words) explaining:
    - What challenges you faced
    - How you debugged issues
    - What part of the API request was tricky (if any)
