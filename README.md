# Zenskar Implementation for Smsworld: Complete Billing Configuration

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation guide for configuring **Smsworld's** billing system using [Zenskar](https://docs.zenskar.com/docs/introduction-to-zenskar), a flexible billing and revenue management platform.

### Business Scenario
**Smsworld** offers three telecommunications products with complex, customer-specific pricing models:

**Products:**
- SMS Service
- WhatsApp Messaging  
- AI SMS Service

**Customers with Unique Pricing:**
- **Customer A (TechCorp)**: Standard per-unit and tiered pricing
- **Customer B (Global Marketing)**: Per-unit pricing with minimum commitment
- **Customer C (StartupConnect)**: Tiered pricing with free allowances

## Zenskar Architecture Implementation

Based on [Zenskar's core concepts](https://docs.zenskar.com/docs/product), our implementation follows this hierarchy:

```
Contract (Customer-specific pricing agreement)
â”œâ”€â”€ Phase (Billing period/terms)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Product (SMS, WhatsApp, AI SMS)
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Pricing Model (Per-unit, Tiered, Volume, etc.)
    â””â”€â”€ Features (Discounts, Taxes, Commitments, etc.)
```

## Pricing Models Utilized

Following [Zenskar's pricing models](https://docs.zenskar.com/docs/pricing-models), we implement:

### Customer A: Multiple Pricing Strategies
- **SMS**: [Per-unit pricing](https://docs.zenskar.com/docs/per-unit-pricing) - $0.01 per SMS delivered
- **WhatsApp**: [Volume pricing](https://docs.zenskar.com/docs/volume-pricing) - $10 per 1,000 messages  
- **AI SMS**: [Tiered pricing](https://docs.zenskar.com/docs/tiered-pricing) - Decreasing rates at volume

### Customer B: Commitment-Based Pricing
- **SMS**: [Per-unit pricing](https://docs.zenskar.com/docs/per-unit-pricing) - $0.02 per SMS sent
- **AI SMS**: [Tiered pricing](https://docs.zenskar.com/docs/tiered-pricing) - Same structure as Customer A
- **Minimum Commitment**: $100/month using Zenskar's [commitment feature](https://docs.zenskar.com/docs/commitment)

### Customer C: Complex Tiered with Free Allowances
- **SMS**: [Per-unit pricing](https://docs.zenskar.com/docs/per-unit-pricing) - $0.01 per SMS delivered
- **WhatsApp**: [Step pricing](https://docs.zenskar.com/docs/step-pricing) with free tier - Flat fees per usage range

## Implementation Structure

## Key Zenskar Features Demonstrated

### Product Management
- Product definition with SKUs, descriptions, and tax codes
- Billable metrics configuration for usage tracking
- Product categorization and organization

### Usage Event Processing
Following [Zenskar's usage event structure](https://docs.zenskar.com/docs/usage-event):
- Event ingestion via API, CSV, and dashboard
- Usage aggregation and billable metric calculation
- Real-time usage tracking and validation

### Contract Flexibility
Using [Zenskar's contract system](https://docs.zenskar.com/docs/create-a-contract-using-the-zenskar-dashboard):
- Customer-specific pricing rules
- Phase-based billing configurations
- Feature customization (taxes, discounts, commitments)

### Invoice Generation
Leveraging [Zenskar's invoice capabilities](https://docs.zenskar.com/docs/invoices-explainer):
- Automated billing cycle processing
- Complex pricing calculation accuracy
- Professional invoice formatting and delivery

## Technical Implementation

### Data Ingestion Methods
1. **API Integration** - Real-time usage event streaming
2. **CSV Upload** - Batch data processing for testing
3. **Dashboard Entry** - Manual event creation for verification

### Usage Event Schema
```json
{
  "event_id": "unique_identifier",
  "customer_id": "customer_a|customer_b|customer_c", 
  "product_code": "SMS_001|WHATSAPP_001|AI_SMS_001",
  "metric_name": "sms_delivered|whatsapp_messages_sent|ai_sms_processed",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "properties": {
    "quantity": 1,
    "additional_metadata": "..."
  }
}
```

### Billable Metrics Configuration
- **sms_delivered**: Counter aggregation for SMS delivery events
- **whatsapp_messages_sent**: Counter aggregation for WhatsApp messages
- **ai_sms_processed**: Counter aggregation for AI SMS processing

## Pricing Calculations Demonstrated

### Customer A Example (March 2024)
```
SMS Service: 12,000 Ã— $0.01 = $120.00
WhatsApp: 15,000 Ã· 1,000 Ã— $10 = $150.00  
AI SMS: (1,000 Ã— $2.00) + (1,000 Ã— $1.00) + (1,500 Ã— $0.50) = $3,750.00
Total: $4,020.00
```

### Customer B Example (Low Usage Month)
```
SMS Service: 1,000 Ã— $0.02 = $20.00
AI SMS: 30 Ã— $2.00 = $60.00
Usage Subtotal: $80.00
Minimum Commitment: $100.00
Final Bill: $100.00 (commitment applied)
```

### Customer C Example (Tier Transition)
```
SMS Service: 7,500 Ã— $0.01 = $75.00
WhatsApp: 1,500 messages â†’ $1.00 (step pricing: 1000-2000 range)
Total: $76.00
```
